                <h1>General’s Ill-Luck Not a Coincidence?</h1>
                <p class="sub">Constella Organiser’s failure sparks suspicion yet again.</p>
                <p><span class="sub">Underworld:</span> This year's Constella performance was held yesterday at Vandeloz Villa. People from all across the Underworld world turned up to witness this visual treat by gifted dancers. Retired Army General (and current Operative) Klanko Venuez was the chief guest for the event. Year after year, Constella consistently serves as our key recruitment tactic, leaving us stronger by hundreds. This year, the honour of planning and executing Operation H was taken up by Mr.Klenko, whose willingness to risk DevCorp’s wrath yet again deserves high praise. It is not easy to reach such heights after recent failures.</p>
                <p>In yesterday’s performance, twenty-four dancers in colourful attires kept the audience captivated with their knack for controlling the wheels in sync. Through the monitors that displayed the top view of the stage, one could see them transforming into flowers, leaves, birds, symbols of various states, companies' logos, and a lot more. The music emanating via sensors in their wheelchairs lingered in every corner of the hall. Depictions of people like us was the highlight, and the storytelling sessions that followed were received with great interest by the working classes. The performance ended with the dancers’ signature way of thanking the audience with a gracious bow joining the two palms. Audience enabled twinkling light in their chairs, and cries of joy echoed everywhere. In the interview that followed, people asked the troupe lead the secret behind their ability to join palms and bow so effortlessly - were there any unique implants on their spines? “Such strength is legendary!” they exclaimed as they congratulated the dancers. “It is the inheritance of us performers,” was all the lead said in reply.</p>
                <p>Mr Klanko’s closing ceremony speech was received just as expected, though unforeseen interventions threatened to ruin the event. The Operative had only said, "Constella art form is a hope to regain long lost abilities. During my working life, I had the privilege to see the true descendants of hum..." before he stopped abruptly. While the intravenous energy-transplant through his assistant revived the Operative, Mr. Klanko denies any knowledge of the immediate events. Predictably, the unease among the audience was quickly lifted, which leads us to wonder if this year will be as successful as the last. Our candidates for the upcoming elections have promised to launch and fastrack an investigation into The Operative’s sudden possession. Public opinion and conspiracies include, but are not exclusive to there being a mole in the Overground. It is fortunate then, that our sources report an increased frequency in the following thoughts in the Underworld: Are the legends true?</p>
