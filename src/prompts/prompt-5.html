                    <h1>Mass Murder Rocks Underworld Residents</h1>
                    <p class="sub">Safety, morality and the meaning of God questioned after a chilling murder mystery is
                        solved.</p>
                    <p><span class="sub">Underworld:</span> About an year ago, when a young woman (in seemingly perfect
                        health and with no known enemies) went missing soon after she left her friend’s home, her family
                        tried to track her down and were informed that she had been permanently eliminated. But imagine
                        the shock the already grieving family met when they found her brutally mauled dead body on the
                        banks of River Wanha. This wasn’t a horrific event that was one of a kind, though. Soon after,
                        there were fourteen other incidents of people who were young and in perfectly good health
                        disappearing from the realm permanently and later being found mauled somewhere. Though people
                        tried to believe that this was just the will of God, since the dates of death were on their
                        calendars, nobody has been able to make any sense out of it. While it is common knowledge that
                        people disappear permanently, events like these are seldom reported.</p>
                    <p>Disappearances are the norm in this realm as death is to those of us above. They always have
                        been, in the Underworld, chalked down to the “workings of God”. But what is the meaning of God
                        if he rips life away from a person in their twenties? That too in such a brutal manner? It means
                        that God had nothing to do with it, especially if the result looks as messy as our past. It is
                        murder, or rather a form of it, known in the Underworld only as part of their wildest myths. We
                        have heard of the horrific murders of Nora and Jorek Ohail at their residence in Coastal
                        Division. Killed brutally by their own bodyguards, this sweet and happy couple were found
                        lifeless with all of their implants missing. Their bodyguards had been desperate for better
                        quality implants and had taken the horrible step of murdering a rich couple for their costly
                        implants. As gruesome as this news was when we first heard of it, a more chilling crime recently
                        came to light when the LEC delved into the disappearances of the young people. This crime was
                        carried out by a coldblooded serial-killer, Dia. Reported to be a maniac, but a very smart one,
                        he had hacked into the Life Control Systems and painted each death as permanent elimination,
                        finding out the dates were on their calendars. And then, he went after the victims and killed
                        them with relish, merely out of bloodlust. As gut-wrenching as his crimes, or perhaps even more
                        chilling is his cruel, manic laughter in the LEC cells when officials approach him.
                        But a more chilling suspicion for those of us who dwell on the surface: was he really just one
                        madman? Or are the citizens of the Underworld finally breaking because of DevCorp's control?
