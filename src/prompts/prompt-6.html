                    <h1>New Evidence: Pre-Takeover Letter Discovered!</h1>
                    <p class="sub">Artifact located by a citizen of the Underworld as part of their ancestral
                        possessions</p>
                    <p><span class="sub">Mali:</span> A trusted source from the Underworld has recently reported of a
                        citizen discovering what seems to
                        be their ancestor’s final letter as part of his heirlooms. While it is hardly surprising that
                        memories of this discovery could have been suppressed or wiped in the preceding generations, the
                        handover of this letter for publishing makes the latest addition to our ever-growing collection
                        of evidence pointing to our continued existence.</p>
                    <p class="letter">Dear Myriam,</p>
                    <p class="letter">I hope you have found asylum, and that the world is better where you are at. They
                        took Emma away
                        yesterday. I couldn’t save her. I’m sorry, I just… I couldn’t. It’s only been a year since the
                        law was passed, but it gets worse with each passing day. Can you remember what Myra looked like?
                        I can’t. I just remember that she had the prettiest smile. Apart from yours, that is. I didn’t
                        want to remember her tears as they took her away, chained at the neck and cuffed. Maybe I should
                        have. Now I wouldn’t know it even if she were the machine that owned me. Is humanity such a bad
                        thing, Myr? The libraries are burning as I write. I don’t know if this letter will ever make it
                        to you. I don’t know if I want it to. You would be happier without knowing how my life matters
                        no more than dirt simply because I am fully human. Do you remember DevCorp? They are the only
                        manufacturers now. Even something as simple as a mechanical eye… they do it for you. Do you
                        remember what they used to tell us when we were kids? That there were things called trees? Do
                        you think people like us will become like that too? A legend? God forbid such a thing ever
                        happens… but I know it will, Myriam. Will you do me a favour? Save this letter like you would
                        your wedding ring. And maybe… maybe in a time when there is no other reality but whatever lie
                        DevCorp is creating… maybe then this would be the proof that matters.</p>

                    <p class="letter">Love,<br />
                        David
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While most other details from the letter are either indiscernible or destroyed, the authenticity
                        of this letter has been tested and verified by ArchaeLab. With time, experts predict such a
                        document could be a turning point in our struggle against oppression.
