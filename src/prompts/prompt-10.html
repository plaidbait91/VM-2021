          <h1>Interview with an Underworld sportsperson</h1>
          <p class="bold">Mr. Roods, it is a very pleasant experience to visit you in your beautiful Crescent. Could you say a few
            words about your work?</p>
          <p>Racing is what I was born to do. When I put on my racer mask, sitting in my voiture de rêve, there's only
            one thing I can think of: winning. I am also part of the game development team. Let me take this opportunity
            to tell you about a recent stress and strength related game developed. It is called Sumo… named after a
            wrestling game from the old childhood legends, if you remember. We have to pass levels where we try to move
            a rock up a hill. The difficulty increases with each level. And you can actually feel the strain in your
            muscles, though it's all in your head. But it's perfectly safe to play. I can't wait for it to reach the
            public.</p>
          <p class="bold">Very interesting! So you say you make games based on legends. Do you believe in the legends?</p>
          <p>Is there any way of absolutely believing in a legend? I can say that I do…</p>
          <p class="bold">Mr. Woods? Are you alright?</p>
          <p>… or I can say that I don't. Neither is a correct answer. Perhaps we did once live in a place where you
            would look up and see an empty blue space instead of the comforting rock ceilings… though I can't imagine
            how humans could have had the bravery to live in such a place. Maybe we have evolved to live like this. Who
            can tell? How did life come about anyways? Who knows? But the stories and legends are nice to listen to.</p>
          <p class="bold">Do you know about DevCorp?</p>
          <p>Excuse me?</p>
          <p class="bold">I mean to ask… who do you believe brought humans to this world below the rocks?</p>
          <p>God, who else? Yes, I do believe in God. I believe in Homocodism, source of all legends. When the world
            above the rocks burned, God saved humanity and put us here.</p>
          <p class="bold">What is your take regarding the ideas of Thinkers that there are people above the rocks?</p>
          <p>Poets write ballads about far away planets. I am no poet. Why can't we just be happy with the world that we
            have? Some say that we are being controlled by someone and we should fight them. Let's say we do and then
            find out that that someone is in turn controlled. Whom are we fighting finally? God? Why can't we accept
            that we were made this way, our bodies are this way?</p>
          <p class="bold">Don't you want to know if it is possible for you to walk and run? Maybe if it's possible for you to race in
            a real car?</p>
          <p>My daughter is five years old. She believes that she can fly if she has wings like some legendary animal.
            Humans can't walk or run any more than they can fly. I am not five years old. I like to live in reality.</p>
          <p>This account raised more questions than we have the capacity to answer at this point. Are the citizens of
            the Underworld further gone than we originally thought? It seems to be that their mentality is much the same
            as ours, but they stubbornly believe in their reality. As wise as the words of Mr. Roods are, it gives quite
            a hopeless feeling to see that this wisdom is used in firmly entangling humanity in the clutches of DevCorp.
