          <h1>"Breakthrough Tech" A Scam?</h1>
          <p class="sub">Audio clip dismissing latest technology as a scam goes viral.</p>
          <p><span class="sub">Peru:</span> It's been barely a few hours since the press release that sent waves of
            celebration all over the Overground, and already there is uproar against teleportation. It is perhaps
            understandable that Professor Yi would be against such a breakthrough considering his personal loss, yet the
            agitation among Outsiders is unexpected but justified. The audio, which has been doing the rounds all day,
            raises concerns on humanitarian grounds.
          </p>

          <p>While such technology would no doubt give us an edge during the upcoming confrontation with DevCorp, is it
            worth the risk? </p>
