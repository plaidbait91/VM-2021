                    <p class="sub">Criminals caught smuggling juvenile implants into Sector 3.</p>
                    <p><span class="sub">Lebanon:</span>On Thursday evening, a gang of smugglers were caught by the
                        Border Security Sensors of Sector 3, trying to smuggle implants into the mainland from the
                        waterways of Sector 6. To escape identification by the Sensors, the accused had removed their
                        Bar-Code eyes, but were caught when one of them accidentally brushed his Humerus-Bar against a
                        Security Sensor’s pole.</p>
                    <p>The smugglers were interrogated at the Law Enforcement Centre of Coastal Division. The records at
                        LEC, Coastal Division showed that the accused had gone to the dangerous extent of removing their
                        Memory-extension Chips in order to keep their secret information safe. In fear of facing the
                        Truth-Pedestals, the gang members self-destructed themselves, using their stomach acids to blast
                        their Circulatory Centre. However, as we all know, the only way to permanently remove the body
                        information is by permanent elimination, as done in the Underworld. Brain-Probes have found that
                        the smugglers belong to the group of activists who call themselves the ‘Penniless Princes’. This
                        information was verified upon interrogating the illegal Street Surgeons near the coast, who
                        confessed to having removed the criminals’ Bar-Code eyes. The Street Surgeons were subsequently
                        arrested. The smuggled goods were found to be juvenile implants worth a sum of seventy-five
                        erdas in Sector 3, but were apparently bought in Sector 6 for a mere sum of twenty-five erdas.
                        The gang had been headed towards the Class three Incubators, perhaps to use the implants on the
                        babies there and smuggle them into the Underworld. The citizens of Worker Division confessed to
                        having collectively debited nearly fifty erdas to the Penniless Princes in the form of gift
                        transfers previously, since they were promised mandatory juvenile implants for their children at
                        a lower price.</p>
                    <p>While a large section of the population condemns the smugglers and their illegal actions, the
                        Social Activists are raising their voices in support of the Penniless Princes, calling them the
                        heroes of the poor. Not only that, it is the belief of many that these illegal implants are
                        blessings in disguise for the residents of the Underworld, protecting them from the tyranny of
                        DevCorp. Struggling under the pressure of necessarily taking the juvenile implants and the high
                        costs of good quality implants, the working class have been requesting concessions. However, the
                        cost of manufacturing has been withholding those concerned from taking the decision to waive the
                        expenses for those who are in need.</p>
                    <p>The developers of these implants insist that the implants are in no way a necessity to their
                        living, but the leaders of the working community say otherwise. ‘The only reason that the
                        government hasn’t been making efforts to reduce the costs for the poor is because they are too
                        involved in pleasing the rich kings out there,’ the President of Worker Division stated angrily
                        to the Report Recorders. ‘We all pay nearly five erdas per household every month. We have the
                        receipts too. We are ready to show them whenever you want us to. Why are we not considered as
                        humans?’ One might even sympathise with the workers Underground, whose worth is measured in
                        terms of how much of them is machinery!</p>
                    <p>Author and Activist Roder Bilans once spoke about the Penniless Princes: ‘They are the heroes of
                        the poor. They remind me of a poem I wrote once about Nodin Koot, a valiant thief who steals
                        from the rich and gives to the poor, riding through…</p>
