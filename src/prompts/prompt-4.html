                    <p class="sub">Candidates promise to tackle the Underground and revoke Section 55T</p>
                    <p><span class="sub">Scotland:</span> The horrifying recollections of the Cyborg Takeover are no
                        doubt running rife this time of the year. It may have taken us centuries to do so, but we humans
                        have finally united. Our ancestors spoke of a Pangea. Now, we are the Overground, finally headed
                        towards our first common election. Long ago, our forefathers dreamed of overthrowing the
                        oppressors, but with a stable government in place, we are inclined to believe that our leaders
                        will see those dreams become reality.</p>

                    <p>Amidst allegations of hoarding resources and outrage among the underprivileged, Candidate Vin has
                        begun monetary donations worth upto a thousand erda. Opposition continues to dismiss these
                        donations as chants of “Batter over Batteries” fill the grounds outside his bunker. Candidate
                        Ray of Opposition claims that Vin’s policy of voluntary implants will soon make this world the
                        same as the Underworld. The spokesperson for Vin is yet to respond. However, she stated during a
                        press release that we can fight the enemy only if we “level the field.”
                        Candidate Vin’s revolutionary Offense Policy, combined with their ambitions for our future, sets
                        them apart from the other candidates. One might even say the multiple controversies have fuelled
                        the candidate’s standing among the Bunker-dwellers. Clearly, the question that we face is now
                        this: will the Bunker-dweller’s wealth compensate for the Outsiders’ numbers?
