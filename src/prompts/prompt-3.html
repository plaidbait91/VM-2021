                    <h1>A ruthless killer or a hero?</h1>
                    <p class="sub">Member of Operation H claims innocent lives in the Underworld, yet to be apprehended.
                    </p>
                    <p>It started about six months ago, when Alrik and Fille Jubree of Ambrew, Sector 5, Underworld,
                        went missing soon after they left a social gathering at Ambrew Hall. Upon investigation, it was
                        found that they had been ‘permanently eliminated’ from the Underworld. In other words, they were
                        dissolved in acid and their remains were drained into the surface seas. Though this permanent
                        elimination done by the Underworld on a regular basis is common news, and the citizens of the
                        Underworld never try to track down these people, misinformed as they are, this incident was
                        something that had made the headlines in the Underworld news channels for weeks on end. The
                        reason: this elimination did not happen on any of the couple’s predestined dates.</p>
                    <p>‘Not a birthday, not an anniversary… nothing,’ said a close friend of the Jubrees. ‘The day is
                        not there on their calendars at all. How could they be eliminated?’
                        That was a question everyone had. And the mysterious eliminations of sixteen other celebrities
                        who were outspoken about the absurdity of the claims of the Middle Class Thinkers regarding the
                        presence of humans above ground only strengthened the issue. After months of investigation, the
                        Underworld authorities have found the reason behind the eliminations: someone had managed to
                        hack into the Life Control Systems of the Underworld. Though the realm has named the man a
                        cold-blooded serial killer, we know better. Unfortunately, he is our beloved Operative, Nefjet
                        Wingh. Frustrated by how these influential members were countering our efforts of spreading the
                        truth to the Underworld, he had decided to take matters into his own hands and went to the realm
                        in disguise to kill them. Once caught by the LEC, Ambrew, he self-destructed himself. In order
                        to save vital information regarding our world from being accessed by the realm, members of
                        Operation H discretely dissolved his brain.
                        While we as a clan grieve the loss of our brave-hearted young leader today, we must all remember
                        and learn from the mistake he has made. As opposed as we are towards those of the Underworld,
                        they are still our brethren. We wish to save them, not kill them. Every cause takes time to take
                        effect and we must wait patiently for the day we see the Earth of our legends.
